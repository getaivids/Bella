A small robot assistant, impossibly wearing a tiny tie 🎀, powers up importantly and proceeds to wildly malfunction, literally launching spreadsheets flying out the window 📜✈️. Her yellow rubber duck (now inexplicably wearing miniature glasses 🤓) watches with an absurdly judgmental gaze. She folds a contract into a paper airplane of resignation, which nose-dives, deadpan, directly into her purple coffee mug ☕🚫. Her expressive eyebrows tell a tragicomic story of defeat.\n",

The cluttered workstation dissolves into a perfectly clean, connected, and streamlined environment. All technologies seamlessly integrate; her screens display intuitive, interlinked interfaces. The yellow rubber duck 🦆, now wearing tiny sunglasses 😎, humorously surfs across the pristine digital interface fluidly. Her expression shifts from fatigue to profound, calm relief and satisfaction.
